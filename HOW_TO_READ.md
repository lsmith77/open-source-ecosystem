# How to Read This Project

This guide helps you navigate the documentation based on your role and what you need to learn.

## Quick Start: 2-Minute Overview

**What is this project?**

This project evaluates metadata standards for open source software and proposes extensions to `publiccode.yml` to make it easier for procurement offices, funders, and security teams to discover, evaluate, and confidently adopt open source projects.

**Why this matters:** The proposal pairs technical standards (metadata, APIs, registries) with a strategic push for public procurement policies that prefer open source. This creates a positive feedback loop: procurement policies create demand for standardized project metadata → projects and vendors adopt the extended standard → procurement offices get better visibility and evaluation tools → more confident open source adoption.

**Who's it for?**

- **Procurement professionals** considering open source adoption
- **Open source project maintainers** seeking visibility with public sector buyers
- **Policy makers** designing procurement requirements or digital sovereignty mandates
- **Vendors/service providers** wanting to demonstrate expertise
- **Researchers** studying open source governance and digital sovereignty
- **Funders** allocating resources to critical open source infrastructure

**What's proposed?**

A comprehensive ecosystem of standards and registries built around publiccode.yml:

**Core Extensions to publiccode.yml:**

1. Faceted classification (better discovery across multiple dimensions)
2. Supply chain references (security assessments, SBOMs, policies)
3. Credit system discovery (vendor contribution tracking)
4. Usage registries (deployment transparency)
5. Temporal field deprecation (cleaner, more trustworthy data)

**Companion Specifications:**

- **Credit Registry API** — Standardized interface for how registries expose vendor/contributor credit data
- **Usage Registry API** — Standardized interface for how registries expose software adoption data
- **Registry Discovery Standard** — How registry operators advertise their existence and capabilities so crawlers can discover them automatically
- **Organization-Level Usage Declarations** — Standard format for organizations to declare what software they deploy (`.well-known/publiccode-usage.json`)

**Policy Layer:**

- **Public procurement policies** (modeled on "Public Money, Public Code") that prefer open source and require standardized evaluation criteria
- **Procurement selection frameworks** that use publiccode.yml metadata as evidence for vendor expertise, supply chain security, and community health
- **Legislative models** and best practices (including Switzerland's EMBAG law as a reference) for mandating open source in government

**Decentralized Trust Networks:**

- **No central authority controls the data.** Registries operate independently in different jurisdictions and sectors, but use standard APIs and discovery mechanisms.
- **Trust is verifiable, not assumed.** Each registry declares its trust model (`verified-domain`, `signed-attestation`, `self-reported`) so consumers can choose data sources matching their risk tolerance.
- **Data drives decisions, not politics.** By making vendor contributions, supply chain security, and software adoption transparently measurable, procurement and policy become evidence-based rather than relationship-based.

Together, these enable a **self-reinforcing, decentralized ecosystem** where procurement demand drives adoption of open source standards, verified through trust networks, which in turn strengthens the vendors and projects within those ecosystems—all while maintaining independence and preventing gatekeeping.

## Tips for Reading

**Terminology tip:** If you see an acronym or unfamiliar term, check [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md) first. It's designed to make everything accessible.

**Links:** Click links to jump between sections. Most documents cross-reference each other so you can read non-linearly.

**Tables:** Scan tables first—they often contain the key insights in compact form.

**Technical sections:** [PROPOSAL.md](PROPOSAL.md) has YAML examples. You don't need to understand YAML syntax; read the descriptions alongside the code blocks.

**Scope boundaries:** Each document tries to be honest about what it does _not_ cover. If something seems missing, check the Risk Analysis and Methodology sections for why.

## Common Questions to Guide You

**"Is this really needed? Doesn't something like this already exist?"**
→ Read [README.md](README.md) for the comparative analysis.

**"What are the real risks and limitations?"**
→ Read [RISK_ANALYSIS.md](RISK_ANALYSIS.md).

**"How would we actually implement this?"**
→ Read [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

**"What does the technical specification look like?"**
→ Read [PROPOSAL.md → Full Example](PROPOSAL.md#full-example).

**"How was this research done? Can I trust the conclusions?"**
→ Read [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md).

**"What's the long-term vision beyond just metadata?"**
→ Read [PITCH.md](PITCH.md) for positioning, then [README.md → Other Relevant Standards](README.md#other-relevant-standards-and-initiatives) for ecosystem context.
